This was my first attempt at creating a website ever. Not having done this I was able to learn about a few new things through this first attempt. The skills that I hadn't really messed with this before include CSS, HTML, git Pages, or git at all really. Though I feel that I have already improved slightly and gotten more used to the environment as I imagine it will be more an more useful skill and experience to work with these things as I move forward.
